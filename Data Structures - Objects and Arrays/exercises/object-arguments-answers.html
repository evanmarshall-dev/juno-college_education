      // Exercise 1:

      // Create a song object that has the following properties: title, artist, album.
      // Write a function called printSongDetails that takes the song object as an argument and console logs the following string: "(artist) released (title) on the album (album)"

      // Exercise 2:

      // Create a person object with name and age properties and write a function called birthdayGreeting that takes the person object as an argument and returns the following string when the person turns a year older: "Happy birthday (name)! You are now (new age) years old!". Console.log the string.

      // Exercise 3:

      // Write a function that takes the `monster` object as an argument returns a swamp monster object. It should have 4 legs and eat people like the `monster` does, but should have a different color. Add a few more properties to describe your swamp monster.

      // Make sure you don't modify the monster object! Console log both objects to make sure.
