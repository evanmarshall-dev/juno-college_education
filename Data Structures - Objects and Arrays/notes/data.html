    <h2>Intro to Data Structures</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>What is a Data Structure?</h3>
    <p>
      When an application needs to keep track of data that is more complex than
      what can be stored in primitive types, we create objects which can store
      more complicated data structures.
    </p>
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Objects are like containers. Inside the containers are properties, which
      are referred to as key-value pairs.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        Example object:
        const myObject = {
          propertyOneName: PropertyOneValue,
          propertyTwoName: PropertyTwoValue,
        }
        // Inside the curly braces is called the object literal
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      Arrays are a type of object which stores data when the order of the data
      matters.
    </p>

    <h3>Retrieving Values</h3>
    <p>This can be done through dot notation or bracket notation.</p>
    <p>You can update or add a property using the same two syntaxes.</p>
