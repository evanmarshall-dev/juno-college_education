      The following should *not* be changed:
        1. The ORDER in which the numbers are declared (must remain in the order of 6, 7, 8 from top to bottom).
        2. The location of the LAST console.log (can not move this console.log earlier).
        3. The VALUES of the declaration.
      
      The following *can* be changed:
        1. The location of the console.logs that are NOT the last console.log. 
        2. The way in which the variables are declared. 

      Currently what prints to the console:
        8
        7
        6

      Desired end goal for what prints to the console:
        6 
        7 
        8
